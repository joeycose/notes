# notes

First, let's create the server and client files for the networking part of the program in Debian. I recommend using the `nano` editor which comes pre-installed with Debian. To create the files, open the terminal and navigate to the folder you created. Use the following commands:

```bash
nano server.py  # creates and opens server.py file in nano
```

Add the following server code inside the `server.py` file:

```python
import socket
import sys
from lottery_ticket_generator import LotteryTicketGenerator, parse_arguments

def handle_client_connection(client_socket, address): # (1)
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    ticket_data = data.decode("utf-8")
    ticket_type, ticket_count = ticket_data.split(",") # (2)
    generator = LotteryTicketGenerator(ticket_type)
    tickets = [generator.generate_ticket() for _ in range(int(ticket_count))]
    response = ";".join(",".join(str(num) for num in ticket) for ticket in tickets)
    client_socket.sendall(response.encode("utf-8")) # (3)

def run_server(port):
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(("", port))
    server_socket.listen(5)

    print(f"Server listening on port {port}")

    while True:
        client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Host {address[0]} connected.")
        handle_client_connection(client_socket, address)
        client_socket.close()
        print(f"Host {address[0]} disconnected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Error: Please provide a port number.")
        sys.exit(1)

    port = int(sys.argv[1])
    run_server(port)
```

Explanation of the server code:

1. This function takes client socket and address as input. It receives the data sent by the client and processes it.
2. It then saves the ticket type and ticket count received from the client.
3. Sends the generated ticket back to the client.

Now, create the `client.py` file:

```bash
nano client.py  # creates and opens client.py file in nano
```

Add the following client code inside the `client.py` file:

```python
import socket
import sys
from lottery_ticket_generator import parse_arguments

def request_tickets(server_address, port, ticket_type, ticket_count):
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect((server_address, port))

    data = f"{ticket_type},{ticket_count}".encode("utf-8")
    client_socket.sendall(data)

    response = client_socket.recv(1024)
    tickets = response.decode("utf-8").split(";")
    tickets = [ticket.split(",") for ticket in tickets]

    client_socket.close()
    return tickets

def main():
    args = parse_arguments()
    server_address = "127.0.0.1"  # Update this with the correct server address
    port = 8000  # Update this with the correct port number

    ticket_type = args.ticket_type
    ticket_count = args.number_of_tickets
    output_file = args.output_file

    tickets = request_tickets(server_address, port, ticket_type, ticket_count)

    for ticket in tickets:
        print(ticket)

    if output_file:
        try:
            with open(output_file, "w") as file:
                for ticket in tickets:
                    file.write(",".join(ticket))
                    file.write("\n")
        except Exception as e:
            print(
                f"Error: Could not write to the output file. Details: {str(e)}")
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

After writing the code in both files, press `Ctrl+X` to exit, followed by `Y` to save the changes, and lastly `Enter` to finish.

To run the server, open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `server.py`, then type: `python3 server.py 8000` (Replace "8000" with any other port number if necessary).

To run the client, open a new terminal and navigate to the folder containing `client.py`, then type: `python3 client.py type1 -n 5` (Change "type1" and "5" to the desired ticket type and quantity).

This is a basic implementation of the server and client for the networked lottery ticket generator. There are various improvements you can make based on your requirements, like adding error handling, or implementing switch cases for IPv6, etc.
