For Prototype D, the requirements indicate that we should use a blocking daemon on a fixed socket with IPv4, and Telnet should be used as the client. We'll modify the `prototype_d_server.py` script to handle the new lottery ticket types as well as provide logging for connecting and disconnecting clients. However, we won't create a new `prototype_d_client.py` as we'll be using Telnet as our client instead.

Here's the code for `prototype_d_server.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import random
import socket


class LotteryTicketGenerator:

    def __init__(self, ticket_type):
        self.ticket_type = ticket_type
        self.number_pool = self._initialize_number_pool()

    def _initialize_number_pool(self):
        if self.ticket_type == "LOTTO_MAX":
            return list(range(1, 51))
        elif self.ticket_type == "LOTTO_6/49":
            return list(range(1, 50))
        elif self.ticket_type == "LOTTARIO":
            return list(range(1, 46))

    def generate_ticket(self):
        ticket = []
        pool = self.number_pool.copy()
        for _ in range(6):
            index = random.randint(0, len(pool) - 1)
            number = pool.pop(index)
            ticket.append(number)
        return sorted(ticket)


def generate_ticket(ticket_type):
    generator = LotteryTicketGenerator(ticket_type)
    return generator.generate_ticket()


def serve_forever(port):
    server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    server.bind(("0.0.0.0", port))
    server.listen(5)

    print("Server is serving on port", port)

    while True:
        conn, addr = server.accept()
        print("Connection from", addr)

        recv_data = conn.recv(1024).decode("utf-8").strip()
        ticket_type, num_tickets, sets = recv_data.split()
        num_tickets = int(num_tickets)
        sets = int(sets)

        tickets = []
        for _ in range(num_tickets * sets):
            ticket = generate_ticket(ticket_type)
            tickets.append(" ".join(map(str, ticket)))

        response = "\n".join(tickets)
        conn.send(response.encode("utf-8"))

        conn.close()
        print("Disconnected from", addr)


def main():
    fixed_port = 9999
    serve_forever(fixed_port)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Testing with Telnet as the client:**

1. Run the `prototype_d_server.py` script first. It will start the server which listens for connections.
2. Open a terminal and type the following command to connect to the server using Telnet:

```
telnet 127.0.0.1 9999
```

Replace `127.0.0.1` with the server's IPv4 address if running the server on a different machine.

3. After connecting, you can enter the ticket_type, num_tickets, and sets separated by spaces, e.g:

```
LOTTO_MAX 1 3
```

Press Enter, and you'll get the requested tickets in response. The server will also log connection and disconnection events in the terminal where it's running.

4. Type `^]` (Ctrl + ]) followed by the `quit` command to exit the Telnet client.
